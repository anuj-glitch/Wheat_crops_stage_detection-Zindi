### Wheat_crops_stage_detection-Zindi
##  Problem -
### Predict which phase of growth wheat crops are in using photos taken by farmers in India

Description - For this competition, you will help us automate one part of the data processing pipeline: estimating the growth stage of a wheat crop based on an image sent in by the farmer. The images are automatically cropped to show a section of the field. Your model must take in an image and output a prediction for the growth stage of the wheat shown, on a scale from 1 (crop just showing) to 7 (mature crop).
